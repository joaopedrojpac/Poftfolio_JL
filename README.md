# Project 1: Creating an NFL Database
## The goal was to help a friend analyse nfl data throughout the season.

Therefore to achive that I used Python to extract and clean the data and Power BI to showcase it.

• Data was extracted using the Selenium Chrome Driver; 

• The cleaning of data was done using the pandas library;

• The dashboards and the database schema were made in Power BI.

## Database Structure
Three fact tables were choosen to gather stats about nfl teams, offensive and defensive players
