# Project 1: Creating an NFL Database ()
In this particular project I helped a friend of mine who wanted to analyse NFL stats throughout the season
using Python and Power BI.

• Data was extracted using the Selenium Chrome Driver 

• The cleaning of data was done using the pandas library

• The dashboards and the database schema was shown in Power BI
