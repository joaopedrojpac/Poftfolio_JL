# Project 1: Creating an NFL Database ()
In this particular project I helped a friend of mine who wanted to analyse NFL stats throughout the season.

Therefore to achive that I used Python and Power BI.

• Data was extracted using the Selenium Chrome Driver; 

• The cleaning of data was done using the pandas library;

• The dashboards and the database schema was shown in Power BI.
